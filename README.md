Project Overview
This C++ application provides a comprehensive solution for managing dormitory operations. It supports various administrative tasks through a modular design, using text files for data storage and a colorful console interface for enhanced user experience. The system is built with maintainability and data integrity in mind, leveraging classes like clsInputValidate and clsUtil for robust functionality.
Features

Student Management:
Add, update, and view student records (e.g., ID, name, dorm building, room number, bed number, status, meal plan).
Track academic details (university, faculty, department, year, section).
