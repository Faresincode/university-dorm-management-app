## Project Overview
This C++ application provides a comprehensive solution for managing dormitory operations. It supports various administrative tasks through a modular design, using text files for data storage and a colorful console interface for enhanced user experience. The system is built with maintainability and data integrity in mind, leveraging classes like `clsInputValidate` and `clsUtil` for robust functionality.

## Features
- **Student Management**:
  - Add, update, and view student records (ID, name, dorm building, room number, bed number, status, meal plan).
  - Track academic details (university, faculty, department, year, section).
  - Manage check-in/check-out dates and student complaints.
- **Employee Management**:
  - Manage employee details (residence name, department, job title, salary, shift, status).
  - Handle shift schedules and security assignments.
- **Visitor Tracking**:
  - Log and update visitor information (ID, name, visit purpose, department, room, status: Inside/Exited, visit/exit times).
  - Filter visitors by name, department, or todayâ€™s visits.
- **Patrol Scheduling**:
  - View and manage security patrol schedules (patrol ID, security ID, location, start/end times, status).
  - Display completed patrols separately.
- **Incident Reporting**:
  - Record and update incident reports (ID, type, description, severity, status, security ID, date).
  - Support for severity levels (Low, Medium, High) and statuses (Open, In Progress, Resolved, Closed).
- **Maintenance Requests**:
  - Track maintenance requests (ID, dorm building, room, issue type, priority, status, assigned staff, request date).
  - Display requests with priority and status details.
- **Login System**:
  - Role-based access with usernames and passwords (e.g., admin, securitychief, financemanager).
  - Track login sessions with timestamps.
- **Data Persistence**:
  - Store all data in text files (e.g., `StudentsDormData.txt`, `VisitorsData.txt`) with `#//#` separators.
  - Support for loading, saving, and updating records.
- **Input Validation**:
  - Robust validation for strings, numbers, and enums to ensure data integrity.
  - Option to skip fields during updates to retain existing data.
- **Console UI**:
  - Color-coded outputs (Green, White, Blue, Yellow, Red) for better readability.
  - Structured menus with clear headers and tables for data display.
